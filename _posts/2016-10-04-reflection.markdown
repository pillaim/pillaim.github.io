This has been a really interesting process. Figuring how to do what I would consider small things actually takes a long time to figure out.

The part that tripped me up the most was changing the layout of something. I chose to add an icon before each page's tagline, but I couldn't figure out anything else that I would want to do. Gravity is pretty minimal, and it's set up just like I would want my personal website to be set up.

In my testing branch, I made the website change colors periodically, and that was really cool. I wanted to incorporate it by pulling in the changes to the master branch, but I didn't want Github to delete the branch. Since I couldn't do that, I decided to make the website red and black themed. I finally figured out how to change the text color in the navigation bar, which was really satisfying. Also, I didn't like how large post titles were, so I decreased post title size. 

Also, I used the one post that we had to do for class as a reason to go through w3schools and figure out how to do a bunch of things. I only included a few things in the post, but it was really interesting to read through the website posts and use the "Try it Yourself" sections to practice using HTML.

The part of the site that I spent the longest on was figuring out how to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript together. I really wanted each of my interest posts to have a slideshow of pictures, but that didn't really work out. I'm planning on continuing to update this site for fun, so figuring out how to make a nice photo display is my next step. I want users to be able to click through the photos, and if the user chooses to click on a photo, a zoomed in image should pop up. If I want to get really fancy with that, I'm going to make each picture differently sized like in a collage.
