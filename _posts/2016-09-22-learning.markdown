In Wednesday's class, we set up our websites using Jekyll themes.
Now, it's time to figure out how to incorporate HTML into my own blog posts.
I'm going to display a few things that I learned  from some HTML tutorials here.

In HTML, lists can be written as such:

```html
<ul>
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Banana</li>
    <li>Pizza</li>
</ul>
```
