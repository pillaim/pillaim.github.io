I've been dancing since I was 6 years old. My sister and I started learning Bharatanatyam when we lived in New York, and then when we moved to North Carolina, we continued learning. 

Bharatanatyam is a classical Indian art form that incorporates rhythmic and interpretive movements.

Recently, my sister had her dance graduation, an arangetram, and we did three dances together. The following picture is from the arangetram photoshoot.
