<p>My written work is a copy of my first community event description, a list of upcoming INLS events, a few quotes about how it’s important to learn how to code, and a picture of coffee that relates to coding.</p>

<h2 id="conversion-description">Conversion Description</h2>
<p>On 10/22, I wrote a script that will take a markdown file and convert it to <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTML</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">DOCX</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ODT</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">PDF</code> formats. I started off the script with an if statement. I made sure that I had my if statement syntax right and then started to read in <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> as my test file. I kept getting errors. I realized that by taking in my input as <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> and using that input variable as the argument in my pandoc commands, I was creating documents like <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md.docx</code>. That’s not what I wanted to do, so I started going through bash syntax to figure out how to get rid of parts of string variables. After I figured that out, I was able to take in a file input and extract the filename from it. My life got a lot easier after I figured that out. I had an executable script that did what the assignment needed me to do. I stopped working on this then.</p>

<p>On 10/24, in class, I realized that I didn’t account for smart quotes, so I added the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-s</code> flag to all of my pandoc commands and put them into a function. That took me a few minutes to understand bash syntax as well because I kept calling the function with <code class="highlighter-rouge">$</code> in front of it. This made me get an error. After taking out the dollar sign, the script worked again. Afterwards, I realized that my error statement wasn’t red, like I wanted it to be, because I forgot to add the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-e</code> tag. I added that, and everything worked like I wanted it to.</p>

<p>On 10/26, I tried to get my output files to put below in the list of files. The script wasn’t working anymore. I was so frustrated because it was working a few days ago. It was glitching at the if statement, so I thought something was wrong with my syntax. I ended up taking out the wildcard in my string comparison, and I used a direct string comparison. To explain further, I took the file input and removed the filename, leaving only the file extension. For example, if a user types in <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.docx</code>, the if statement will only read the <code class="highlighter-rouge">docx</code> portion, see that it is not equal to <code class="highlighter-rouge">md</code>, and produce an error.</p>
