    <p>This has been a really interesting process. Figuring how to do what I would consider small things actually takes a long time to figure out.</p>

<p>The part that tripped me up the most was changing the layout of something. I chose to add an icon before each page’s tagline, but I couldn’t figure out anything else that I would want to do. Gravity is pretty minimal, and it’s set up just like I would want my personal website to be set up.</p>

<p>In my testing branch, I made the website change colors periodically, and that was really cool. I wanted to incorporate it by pulling in the changes to the master branch, but I didn’t want Github to delete the branch. Since I couldn’t do that, I decided to make the website red and black themed. I finally figured out how to change the text color in the navigation bar, which was really satisfying. Also, I didn’t like how large post titles were, so I decreased post title size.</p>

<p>Also, I used the one post that we had to do for class as a reason to go through w3schools and figure out how to do a bunch of things. I only included a few things in the post, but it was really interesting to read through the website posts and use the “Try it Yourself” sections to practice using HTML.</p>

<p>The part of the site that I spent the longest on was figuring out how to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript together. I really wanted each of my interest posts to have a slideshow of pictures, but that didn’t really work out. I’m planning on continuing to update this site for fun, so figuring out how to make a nice photo display is my next step. I want users to be able to click through the photos, and if the user chooses to click on a photo, a zoomed in image should pop up. If I want to get really fancy with that, I’m going to make each picture differently sized like in a collage.</p>
