    <h1 id="who-did-what--process">Who did what + Process:</h1>
<p>Wow, it seems like we’ve been working on this project for a really long time. Jailine and I started this project trying to figure out some way to talk about technology in medicine. We finally decided to talk about 3D printing. In the beginning, we just thought of bioprinting. I watched a TED talk about 3D printing a kidney a while ago, and we were mainly talking about how cool it was to print organs. Then, we both researched other applications of 3D printing and found that it’s very cost-efficient to print medical tools and surgical planning tools.</p>

<p>After figuring out the outline, I realized that it would be cool to actually 3D print something for the presentation and record the process. For my community event, I went to a 3D printing workshop, and after the workshop I asked about printing a vertebra and recording the print. Jailine and I went to record the process a few days later.</p>

<p>Then, we reserved the SILS media lab to record audio for each of our slides. Jailine wrote the base script, and I edited and added more to it. Then, we both took turns recording. Afterwards, we met again to put everything together. Jailine added the script parts to the speaker notes, and we both added and removed slides and pictures. It was nice to meet up and knock everything out together, so we didn’t have to worry about merge conflicts. We made sure that we were on top of telling each other when to pull before editing.</p>

<p>Then, I ran into some problems with how big the video was. After talking to Jailine about it, we decided to wait until today (Monday) to work on adding audio and video to the slides. Today, we ran into a huge problem with git. I had pushed the 127 mb video to Github, and git’s max is 100 mb. Even after deleting the video locally, git still remembered it. I ended up having to reset the git history, but fortunately, the only thing Jailine had done by then was upload the audio files. After resetting, she uploaded them again, and we were back in business.</p>

<p>After running into multiple errors with the audio and video, we got it working, and I was excited to experiment with the html and css. After changing the theme, slide transitions, uncentering the slide titles, changing font colors, adding a background image and adjusting image sizes, I was happy. It finally looked a lot prettier than it did in class today. I’m definitely happy with our final project.</p>

<h1 id="lightbulbs">Lightbulbs:</h1>
<p>I didn’t realize a lot of the lightbulbs until class today. I was really thankful that Jailine and I recorded all of the audio in one sitting because it made the presentation more uniform. Another huge lightbulb was when I realized that git remembered the giant video I tried to push. It reminded me of a lecture from two months ago about how git is a powerful metadata tool and big files clog space.</p>

<h1 id="challenges">Challenges:</h1>
<p>Incorporating the video was the biggest challenge. Jailine and I wanted to include it because of how crucial we think it is to the presentation, but it was definitely a lot of work. I think it turned out well in the end though. Then, understanding how the audio worked was another challenge, but once we got that, it was simple. We had a few close calls when we thought we broke the presentation, but everything was fine.</p>

<p>Our attitude in most of this project:

<h1 id="use-of-skills-in-project">Use of skills in project:</h1>
<p>There was a lot of work in html and css in this project. Aside from technical skills, I think this project required a lot of patience. I can be impatient sometimes, but I’ve learned that force reloading a page multiple times isn’t going to make it magically work.</p>

<h1 id="use-of-skills-in-future">Use of skills in future:</h1>
<p>I’m definitely happy about how much we’ve used html and css in this class. Especially in this project, it was awesome to try and figure out how to incorporate different things within reveal’s framework. I got pretty excited about it at times. In the future, I’m probably going to end up using html and css again. I want this website to function as my personal website after this class, so I’ll be editing it a lot in the future.</p>
