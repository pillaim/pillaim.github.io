Hi!

I'm currently a 4th year PhD student in Health Informatics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My dissertation research is on computational drug repurposing candidates using electronic medical records.

I am also doing projects in UNC Department of Radiation Oncology on augmenting quality assurance measures with machine learning and in UNC Department of Nursing on evaluating patient experience for telehealth encounters in a virtual clinic.

Take a look at the rest of my website to learn more!
